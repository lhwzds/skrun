# Manage Tasks

Use this skill for long-running or scheduled work executed by tasks.

## Inputs

- Task intent or agent ID.
- Optional run configuration such as timeout, schedule, and memory scope.

## Procedure

1. Inspect existing tasks.
- Use `manage_tasks` with `operation: list` first.
- Reuse an existing task when possible.

2. Create or run as needed.
- For new work, create a task definition.
- Trigger execution with `operation: run`.
- Before `create`, `convert_session`, `promote_to_background`, `run`, `run_batch`, or `control` with `run_now`, call `manage_tasks` with `preview: true`.
- If preview returns warnings, summarize them and wait for user confirmation before retrying with `approval_id`.
- If preview returns blockers, stop and report the blockers.

3. Track health and progress.
- Query `operation: progress` for recent events.
- Use `operation: list_artifacts` for typed run outputs.
- Use `operation: list_messages` to inspect runtime conversation if needed.

4. Operate safely.
- Pause, resume, or stop only for explicit operational reasons.
- Send user messages through `operation: send_message` when interaction is required.

## Rules

- Prefer `run` on an existing definition over creating duplicates.
- Keep lifecycle transitions explicit and auditable.
- Do not delete tasks unless explicitly requested.
