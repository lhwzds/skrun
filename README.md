# skrun

skrun is a Python-first executable skill runtime that lets agent frameworks
discover, build, install, and call local skills.

## Principles

- Use short module names.
- Give each module a narrow responsibility.
- Keep UI interaction out of runtime semantics.
- Keep durable storage out of the executable skill runtime.
- Keep Python bindings at the same module boundary as Rust APIs.
- Support external agent frameworks instead of replacing their main agent loop.
- Make Rust binary skills and uv-backed Python skills first-class.

## Modules

```text
agent   agent loop and execution planning
bridge  legacy migration DTOs and import checks
skill   skill catalog, mentions, and per-turn capability planning
tool    tool trait and registry
runtime executable skill artifacts, scaffold, build, and run
cli     minimal executable skill commands
run     Task/Run durable execution model
chat    sessions, turns, and messages
engine  core composition and command execution
proto   CoreCommand, CoreResponse, and CoreSnapshot protocol types
server  command and JSON ingress for product shells
store   repository traits and backend contracts
model   providers, models, selectors, and runtime model specs
auth    secrets, auth profiles, and provider access policy
event   stream, trace, and telemetry event types
```

## Executable Skills

skrun supports two local artifact kinds:

```text
rust_binary  Cargo-built executable skill, called with stdin/stdout JSON
python_uv    uv-managed Python project, called with stdin/stdout JSON
```

Each skill directory contains an `artifact.json` manifest:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "kind": "rust_binary",
  "id": "regex-finder",
  "name": "Regex Finder",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "entry": "bin/release/regex-finder",
  "protocol": {
    "transport": "stdio-json",
    "input": "single-json-value",
    "output": "single-json-value"
  },
  "schema": {
    "input": "schema/input.json",
    "output": "schema/output.json"
  }
}
```

The initial protocol is intentionally strict:

- input is one JSON value written to stdin
- output is one JSON object written to stdout
- stderr is diagnostics
- non-zero exit is failure
- streaming is not part of the first executable skill contract

## Python Package Loop

The PyPI distribution and Python import are both `skrun`. The Python package is
backed by the Rust `skrun-native` PyO3 module. Use the packaging helper so local
installs and release wheels use the same settings:

```bash
python3 -m pip install maturin
python3 python/scripts/package.py develop
python3 python/scripts/package.py smoke
python3 python/scripts/package.py build
python3 python/scripts/package.py sdist
```

The helper sets `PYO3_PYTHON` and keeps Cargo artifacts under
`/tmp/skrun-python-target` by default, which avoids executing Rust build
artifacts from an external macOS volume.

## Python Skill API

The high-level Python API calls local executable skill artifacts through the
same Rust `runtime` crate used by the CLI:

```python
import skrun

result = skrun.skill("/path/to/skill").call({"pattern": "TODO", "path": "."})
```

By default, skill IDs resolve under `~/.skrun/skills`, or under the directory
set by `SKRUN_SKILLS_DIR`. The Python package requires the
`skrun_native` PyO3 extension for executable skill operations; it does not
maintain a separate subprocess runtime fallback.

## CLI Skill Loop

The minimal CLI exists only for executable skills:

```bash
cargo run -p cli -- \
  skill new --kind rust_binary --id rust-echo /tmp/rust-echo

cargo run -p cli -- \
  skill build /tmp/rust-echo

cargo run -p cli -- \
  skill run --input '{"ok":true}' /tmp/rust-echo

cargo run -p cli -- \
  skill install-local --root /tmp/skrun-skills --overwrite /tmp/rust-echo

cargo run -p cli -- \
  skill list --root /tmp/skrun-skills
```

Example skills live under `examples/skills`.

## Agent Framework Examples

skrun does not replace the main agent framework. Wrap executable skills from
the framework you already use:

```python
import skrun


def regex_finder_tool(arguments: dict) -> dict:
    return skrun.skill("regex-finder").call(arguments)
```

Dependency-light examples live under `examples/frameworks` for LangChain,
LangGraph, PydanticAI, and OpenAI Agents-style tool bodies.

## Non-Goals For This Slice

- Do not open or migrate production databases.
- Do not duplicate the current TUI/Web implementation.
- Do not implement a main agent framework.
- Do not implement a remote marketplace UI.
- Do not implement streaming executable skills.
